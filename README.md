# Resume-Builder
The purpose of the Resume Builder is to create a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for resume building, i.e. converting raw resume data to a structured resume based on a chosen template.
This project is being developed as part of our practical course Design Lab (CS891) (previously in our Software Engineering (CS791), we were involved with building a Resume Parser and Evaluator) but is aimed towards deployment and integration into any recruitment firm or employment processes where resume selection takes up a sizable amount of employee detail processing. The Resume Builder would be facilitating the employees to make and print their resumes in a proper format. In addition, it will be facilitating the higher management to search the employees depending upon their skills sets and other attributes.
The 'Online Resume Builder' has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardships faced by this existing system. Moreover this system is designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner. 
The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data. It also provides an error message while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge is needed for the user to use this system. Thus by this all it proves it is user-friendly. Online Resume Builder , as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast management systems. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather than concentrate on the record keeping. Thus it will help organizations in better utilization of resources. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You would need Node JS and npm to run this project. [Node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
