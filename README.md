# Resume-Builder
The purpose of the Resume Builder is to create a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for resume building, i.e. converting raw resume data to a structured resume based on a chosen template.
This project is being developed as part of our practical course Design Lab (CS891) (previously in our Software Engineering (CS791), we were involved with building a Resume Parser and Evaluator) but is aimed towards deployment and integration into any recruitment firm or employment processes where resume selection takes up a sizable amount of employee detail processing. The Resume Builder would be facilitating the employees to make and print their resumes in a proper format. In addition, it will be facilitating the higher management to search the employees depending upon their skills sets and other attributes.
The 'Online Resume Builder' has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardships faced by this existing system. Moreover this system is designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner. 
The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data. It also provides an error message while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge is needed for the user to use this system. Thus by this all it proves it is user-friendly. Online Resume Builder , as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast management systems. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather than concentrate on the record keeping. Thus it will help organizations in better utilization of resources.
